## NEW IDEA

This app will work as a database of patients and disease. A doctor can create a patient by inserting the patients information, symptoms and vitals. The app will then read through disease table and determine which disease is ailing the patient. The doctor may also see the status of all patients and update the status of all patients. The doctor may also view a cheat sheet of all the disease and their symptoms read from the diseases table.

EXTRA: The app can also simulate the changing vitals of the patient and it will change the patient's disease.

## OLD STUFF

This is a gameified app that simulates a pandemic-time hospital.
The app uses a database to keep track of checked in patients and their personal information and health conditions.
The database would have a true/false status for COVID infections.
Randomuser.me will be used to randomly generate people to be admitted to hospital.
Chart.js can be used to graph the status of COVID, various health risks, and capacity in the hospital.
If a patient has covid, automatically put them into quarantine and redirect from there.
​
Potential idea: analyze the infection rates of patients and implement stricter/looser social distance measures, and make that affect
the rate of infections. Chart results.
​
Potential idea: Have a random chance of patient dying during treatment.
​
Make us of something like https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/disease-names.php or https://thestoryshack.com/tools/disease-name-generator/ to generate random disease names. Could manually create a database that ouputs a randomized disease name.
​
Look into this further: https://covid19api.com/
​
Use https://avatars.dicebear.com/ for random patient pic generation and https://randomuser.me/ for random data generation.
​
For each patient generate a patient card with handlebars.
Create hospital wards, have the ability to auto-assign or manually assign patients to wards.
